This is an command line based emulator for the DCPU-16 CPU (1.7) of the game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).

Project source code can be found at: https://github.com/fasd21/dcpu-emu

All contributions are welcomed.

--------------------------------------

I knew the DCPU-16 by the Android APP ADCPU (Android package name: uk.co.sticksoft.adce). I love this thing and wrote an OS for it happily. But I was very sad when I found that ADCPU have a bug which broke the floppy disk hardware.

Now, I want to make a tiny but reliable DCPU-16 emulator, in C and works on command line, and keep updating. If you like this project too, please, tell me at least. I will be grateful if anyone likes my work.

Note: I forked Imajie/dcpu-emu, and the first thing to do is cleaning -- make it simple and command-line-based.
