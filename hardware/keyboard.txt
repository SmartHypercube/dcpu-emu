Fasd Keyboard v0.1

DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Keyboard
    ID: 0xec402d15, version: 0x0001
    Manufacturer: 0xFA5D0000 (Fasd)

Description:
    Fasd Keyboard can deal with the input of stdin while running. When a key was tapped, it will call an interrupt. Before using it, remember to enable it :)

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the Keyboard, it reads the A register and does one of the following actions:

0x0000: enable/disable
    if B==0, Keyboard will be disabled. Otherwise Keyboard will be enabled and the input buffer will be wiped, the interrupt number will be set to B.
    When there's a key event, the key is stored and Keyboard makes a interrupt. Then you should use func 0x0001 to get the key.

0x0001: get a char
    Get a char in A. A==0xFFFF means the end-of-file.
