        <p>This is an command line based emulator for the DCPU-16 CPU (1.7) of the game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com). And I added many features I think will be interesting to it.</p>

<p>Note: This file has a Chinese (Simple) version, which is 'README.zh-CN.md' .</p>

<p>=== FEATURES ===</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast Mode</li>
</ul><p>Many people want to code for dcpu, even write an OS for it. So it's necessary to make it faster. In Fast Mode, the frequency has no limits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Closure</li>
</ul><p>I'm trying my best to make sure this emulator close. Whatever happened in the dcpu, this emulator will never throw an error or print something (unless it's some hardwares' goal).</p>

<ul>
<li>... and more (waiting for your idea!)</li>
</ul><p>Project source code can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/fasd21/dcpu-emu">https://github.com/fasd21/dcpu-emu</a></p>

<p>All contributions are welcomed.</p>

<hr><p>I knew the DCPU-16 by the Android APP ADCPU (Android package name: uk.co.sticksoft.adce). I love this thing and wrote an OS for it happily. But I was very sad when I found that ADCPU have a bug which broke the floppy disk hardware.</p>

<p>Now, I want to make a tiny but reliable DCPU-16 emulator, in C and works on command line, and keep updating. If you like this project too, please, tell me at least. I will be grateful if anyone likes my work.</p>

<p>Note: I forked github.com/Imajie/dcpu-emu.</p>
