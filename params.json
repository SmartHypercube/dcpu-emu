{"name":"Dcpu-emu","tagline":"a reliable DCPU-16 emulator based on the command line.","body":"This is an command line based emulator for the DCPU-16 CPU (1.7) of the game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com). And I added many features I think will be interesting to it.\r\n\r\nNote: This file has a Chinese (Simple) version, which is 'README.zh-CN.md' .\r\n\r\n=== FEATURES ===\r\n\r\n* Fast Mode\r\n\r\nMany people want to code for dcpu, even write an OS for it. So it's necessary to make it faster. In Fast Mode, the frequency has no limits.\r\n\r\n* Closure\r\n\r\nI'm trying my best to make sure this emulator close. Whatever happened in the dcpu, this emulator will never throw an error or print something (unless it's some hardwares' goal).\r\n\r\n* ... and more (waiting for your idea!)\r\n\r\nProject source code can be found at: https://github.com/fasd21/dcpu-emu\r\n\r\nAll contributions are welcomed.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI knew the DCPU-16 by the Android APP ADCPU (Android package name: uk.co.sticksoft.adce). I love this thing and wrote an OS for it happily. But I was very sad when I found that ADCPU have a bug which broke the floppy disk hardware.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to make a tiny but reliable DCPU-16 emulator, in C and works on command line, and keep updating. If you like this project too, please, tell me at least. I will be grateful if anyone likes my work.\r\n\r\nNote: I forked github.com/Imajie/dcpu-emu.\r\n\r\nFasd Snake <fasd.snake@gmail.com>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
