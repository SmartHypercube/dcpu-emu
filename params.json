{"name":"Dcpu-emu","tagline":"a reliable DCPU-16 emulator based on the command line.","body":"This is an command line based emulator for the DCPU-16 CPU (1.7) of the game 0x10c (link: 0x10.com).\r\n\r\nProject source code can be found at: https://github.com/fasd21/dcpu-emu\r\n\r\nAll contributions are welcomed.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI knew the DCPU-16 by the Android APP ADCPU (Android package name: uk.co.sticksoft.adce). I love this thing and wrote an OS for it happily. But I was very sad when I found that ADCPU have a bug which broke the floppy disk hardware.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to make a tiny but reliable DCPU-16 emulator, in C and works on command line, and keep updating. If you like this project too, please, tell me at least. I will be grateful if anyone likes my work.\r\n\r\nNote: I forked Imajie/dcpu-emu, and the first thing to do is cleaning -- make it simple and command-line-based.\r\n\r\nFasd Snake <fasd.snake@gmail.com>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
